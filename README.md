**f1 Project README**

## Overview
The f1 project utilizes Swift and ARKit to bring the Australian Formula 1 track to life in augmented reality (AR). The project dynamically represents cars as dots on the track, integrating real-time data from the openF1 API to simulate their movement around the track.

## Features
- **Augmented Reality Representation:** The project leverages ARKit to overlay the Australian Formula 1 track onto the real world, providing an immersive experience.
- **Real-time Data Integration:** Utilizing the openF1 API, the project fetches real-time data about the position and status of Formula 1 cars and integrates it into the AR simulation.
- **Dynamic Movement Simulation:** Cars are represented as dots and are animated to move around the track in real-time according to the data received from the openF1 API.

## Requirements
- iOS device supporting ARKit
- Xcode
- Swift knowledge
- Internet connection for real-time data fetching from the openF1 API

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the project on an iOS device.

## Usage
1. Launch the application on your iOS device.
2. Point your device's camera towards a flat surface.
3. Wait for the ARKit to detect and initialize the Australian Formula 1 track.
4. Once the track is displayed, dots representing Formula 1 cars will appear on the track.
5. These dots will move in real-time around the track, simulating the movement of the actual cars in the race.
6. Enjoy watching the dynamic simulation and explore the track from different angles using your device.
